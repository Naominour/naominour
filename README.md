👋 Hi there! I’m Naeimeh Nour – and I’m Really Passionate about learning.
After earning my Bachelor’s in computer science from the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, I entered the IT world as an employee to explore my passion for Programming, IT support, and Web development.
Since August 2019, I’ve started my own business “Manolight”, where I've focused on selling personalized gifts, home design decors, and exciting stuff on a great online platform for everyone.
Professionally, I’m motivated by AI, NLP, and Machine Learning, which have helped me to think about new careers and start a new journey in my path.
Outside of work, I recharge by reading books or hiking. What I appreciate about my job is being able to pursue both my personal goals and professional passions with equal gusto – honestly, I think it makes me a better person.
