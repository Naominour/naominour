My journey into AI began with a simple desire: to understand how technology can find valuable insights from data. While managing an online shop, I became fascinated with analyzing user feedback using sentiment analysis. That experience sparked my passion for artificial intelligence and led me to a master's degree in AI, where I discovered my true calling as a programmer and machine learning engineer.

Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to advancing my technical expertise and contributing to impactful AI projects. I specialised in 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲-𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀, designing and implementing innovative 𝗡𝗟𝗣 and 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, and building 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 using tools such as 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿, 𝗠𝗟𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗜/𝗖𝗗 𝗽𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗺𝘆 𝗔𝗜 𝗷𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆:

✔️ Fine-tuned large language models like 𝗚𝗣𝗧 and 𝗟𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗮 from scratch across various domains.</br>
✔️ Earned the Microsoft 𝗔𝘇𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝗜-𝟵𝟬𝟬 certification, demonstrating a good understanding of Azure’s AI services and tools.</br>
✔️ Achieved 95% accuracy in 𝗹𝘂𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 using Gradient Boosting.</br>
✔️ Developed multiple deployment-ready AI models, including 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗔𝗚 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, and building tools like 𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀, 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀.</br>
✔️ Co-authored an 𝗜𝗘𝗘𝗘-𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿 paper on explainable AI for operational risk evaluation, advancing ethical AI practices.</br>
✔️ Collaborated with 𝟮𝟬+ 𝗦𝗠𝗘𝘀 to develop 𝗔𝗜-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹 as a Machine Learning Engineer at D-Ready.</br>


With a solid foundation in programming languages like 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 and a deep understanding of 𝗠𝗟𝗢𝗽𝘀 practices, my goal is to build AI systems that are both advanced and meaningful, projects that push technology forward while remaining reliable, ethical, and truly beneficial in the real world. 
If you’re looking for a dedicated engineer focused on AI, 𝗹𝗲𝘁’𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁! I’m always excited to explore new opportunities and challenges in this field.✨
